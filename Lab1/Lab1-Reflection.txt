Virtual memory is the extension of existing RAM that a program is allowed to use.
This memory is more than the actual RAM available in the Operating system. This supports 
the /proc folder because it's run on Virtual Memory.

Resident memory is the actual memory that are stored in the physical RAM and available for the
programs to use.
